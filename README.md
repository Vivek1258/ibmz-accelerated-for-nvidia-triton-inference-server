# Overview <a id="overview"></a>

[Triton Inference Server](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/archives/triton-inference-server-2410/user-guide/docs/user_guide/architecture.html) is
an open source fast, scalable, and open-source AI inference server, by
standardizing model deployment and execution streamlined and optimized for high
performance. The Triton Inference Server can deploy AI models such as deep
learning (DL) and machine learning (ML).

Client program initiates the inference request to Triton Inference Server.
Inference requests arrive at the server via either HTTP/REST or GRPC or by the C
API and are then routed to the appropriate per-model scheduler. Triton
implements multiple scheduling and batching algorithms that can be configured
per model-by-model basis. Each model's scheduler optionally performs batching of
inference requests and then passes the requests to the corresponding backend
module based on the model type. The backend performs inferencing using the
inputs (duly pre-processed) to produce the requested outputs. The outputs are
then returned to the client program.

The Triton Inference Server provides a backend API that exposes a C API along with backend libraries and frameworks in an optimized way, enabling support for ONNX-MLIR on IBM Z.

Triton Inference Server python backend enables pre-processing, post-processing
and server models written in python programming language. This enables IBM Snap
ML support on IBM Z.

The models being served by Triton Inference Server can be queried and controlled
by a dedicated model management API that is available by HTTP/REST or GRPC
protocol, or by the C API.

The model repository is a file-system based repository of the models that Triton Inference Server will make available for a
deployment.

On IBM® z16™ and later (running Linux on IBM Z or IBM® z/OS® Container
Extensions (IBM zCX)), With Triton Inference server 2.48.0 python backend for IBM
Snap ML or custom backend like ONNX-MLIR will leverage new inference
acceleration capabilities that transparently target the IBM Integrated
Accelerator for AI through the
[IBM z Deep Neural Network (zDNN)](https://github.com/IBM/zDNN) library. The IBM
zDNN library contains a set of primitives that support Deep Neural Networks.
These primitives transparently target the IBM Integrated Accelerator for AI on
IBM z16 and later. No changes to the original model are needed to take advantage
of the new inference acceleration capabilities.

## Launch IBM Z Accelerated for NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server container

Launching and maintaining IBM Z Accelerated Triton™ Inference Server revolves
around official

[quick start](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r24.07/docs/getting_started/quickstart.md)
tutorial.

This documentation will cover :

- [Creating a Model Repository](#create-model-repository)
- [Launching IBM Z Accelerated for NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server](#start-triton-server)
- [Deploying the model](#security-and-deployment-guidelines)

## Creating a Model Repository <a id="create-model-repository"></a>

User can follow the steps describe at
[model repository](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r24.07/docs/user_guide/model_repository.md)
to create a model repository. The following steps would launch the Triton
Inference Server.

## Launching IBM Z Accelerated for NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server <a id="start-triton-server"></a>

By default services of IBM Z Accelerated for NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server
docker container listening at the following ports.

| Service Name                   | Port |
| ------------------------------ | :--: |
| HTTP – Triton Inference Server | 8000 |
| GRPC – Triton Inference Server | 8001 |
| HTTP – Metrics                 | 8002 |

IBM Z Accelerated for NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server can be launched by
running the following command.

```bash
docker run --shm-size 1G --rm
    -p <EXPOSE_HTTP_PORT_NUM>:8000
    -p <EXPOSE_GRPC_PORT_NUM>:8001
    -p <EXPOSE_Metrics_PORT_NUM>:8002
    -v $PWD/models:/models <triton_inference_server_image> tritonserver
    --model-repository=/models
```

Use IBM Z Accelerated for NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server's REST API endpoint
to verify if the server and the models are ready for inferencing. From the host
system use curl to access the HTTP endpoint that provides server status.

```bash
curl -v localhost:8000/v2/health/ready
```

```bash
...
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Length: 0
< Content-Type: text/plain
```

The HTTP request returns status 200 if IBM Z Accelerated for NVIDIA Triton™
Inference Server is ready and non-200 if it is not ready.

# Security and Deployment Guidelines <a id="security-and-deployment-guidelines"></a>

Once the model been available either on a system or in a
[model repository](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r24.07/docs/user_guide/model_repository.md),
model can be deployed automatically by specifying the path to the model location
while launching the Triton Inference Server.

Command to start the Triton Inference Server

```bash
docker run --shm-size 1G --rm \
    -p <TRITONSERVER_HTTP_PORT_NUM>:8000 \
    -p <TRITONSERVER_GRPC_PORT_NUM>:8001 \
    -p <TRITONSERVER_METRICS_PORT_NUM>:8002 \
    -v $PWD/models:/models <triton_inference_server_image>   tritonserver \
    --model-repository=/models
```

## Triton Inference Server using HTTPS/Secure gRPC

Configuring Triton Inference Server for HTTPS and gRPC Secure ensures secure and
encrypted communication channels, protecting clients and server data
confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

### HTTPS

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of the HTTP
protocol used for communication between clients (such as web browsers) and
servers over the internet. It provides encryption and secure data transmission
by using SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) protocols.

Reverse proxy servers can help secure Triton Inference Server communications
with HTTPS by protecting backend servers and enabling secure communication and
performance required to handle incoming request well.

The HTTPS protocol ensures that the data exchanged between the client and server
is encrypted and protected from eavesdropping or tampering. By configuring
reverse proxy server with HTTPS, you enable secure communication between the
Triton Inference Server and clients, ensuring data confidentiality and
integrity.

### Secure gRPC

Triton Inference Server supports the gRPC protocol, which is a high-performance.
gRPC provides efficient and fast communication between clients and servers,
making it ideal for real-time inferencing scenarios.

Using gRPC with Triton Inference Server offers benefits such as high
performance, bidirectional streaming, support for client and server-side
streaming, and automatic code generation for client and server interfaces.

**SSL/TLS**: gRPC support SSL/TLS and the use of SSL/TLS to authenticate the
server, and to encrypt all the data exchanged between the gRPC client and the
Triton Inference Server. Optional mechanisms are available for clients to
provide certificates for mutual authentication

# IBM Z Accelerated for NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server Backends <a id="triton-server-backends"></a>

IBM Z Accelerated for NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server supports three backends as
of today.

- [Python Backend](#python-backend)
- [ONNX-MLIR Backend](#onnx-mlir-backend)
- [Snap ML C++ Backend](#snapml-cpp-backend)

## Python Backend <a id="python-backend"></a>

Python backend Triton Inference Server has a Python backend that allows you to
deploy machine learning models written in Python for inference. This backend is
known as the "Python backend" or "Python script backend."

For more details about triton python backend are documented [here](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/python_backend/tree/r24.07?tab=readme-ov-file#user-documentation)

Format of the python backend model directory looks like below

```text
$ model_1
   |-- 1
   |   |-- model.py
   |   `-- model.txt
   `-- config.pbtxt
```

### Minimal Model Configuration
Every Python Backend model must provide config.pbtxt file describing the model configuration.
Below is a sample ```config.pbtxt``` for Python Backend:

```
max_batch_size: 32
input {
  name: "IN0"
  data_type: TYPE_FP32
  dims: 5
}
output {
  name: "OUT0"
  data_type: TYPE_FP64
  dims: 1
}
backend: "python"
```
#### Configuration Parameters:
Triton Inference Server exposes some flags to control the execution mode of models through parameters section in the model’s config.pbtxt file.

- **Backend** :
   Backend parameter must be provided as “python” while utilising ONNX-MLIR Backend. For more details related to backend [here](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/backend/blob/r24.07/README.md#backends)
   
   ```
   backend: "python"
   ```
   
- **Inputs and Outputs:** : 
    Each model input and output must specify a name, datatype, and shape. The name specified for an input or output tensor must match the name expected by the model. For more details on inputs and output tensors check documentation of Triton Inference server [here](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r24.07/docs/user_guide/model_configuration.md#inputs-and-outputs)
    
For more options see [Model Configuration](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r24.07/docs/user_guide/model_configuration.md#model-configuration).
    
Using the Python backend in Triton is especially useful for deploying custom
models or models developed with specific libraries that are not natively
supported by Triton's other backends. It provides a flexible way to bring in
your own machine learning code and integrate it with the server's inference
capabilities. It provides flexibility by allowing you to use any Python machine
learning library to define your model's inference logic.

NOTE:

1. model.py should be there in the model repository to use the python backend framework.
2. Multiple versions are supported, only positive values as version model are supported

## ONNX-MLIR Backend <a id="onnx-mlir-backend"></a>

A triton backend which allows the deployment of onnx-mlir or zDLC compiled
models (model.so) with the triton inference server. For more details about the
onnx-mlir backend are documented
[here](https://github.com/IBM/onnxmlir-triton-backend)

Format of the onnx-mlir backend model directory looks like below

```text
$ model_1
    |-- 1
    |   `-- model.so
    `-- config.pbtxt
```

### Minimal Model Configuration
Every ONNX-MLIR Backend model must provide config.pbtxt file describing the model configuration.
Below is a sample ```config.pbtxt``` for ONNX-MLIR Backend:

```
max_batch_size: 32
input {
  name: "IN0"
  data_type: TYPE_FP32
  dims: 5
  dims: 5
  dims: 1
}
output {
  name: "OUT0"
  data_type: TYPE_FP64
  dims: 1
}
backend: "onnxmlir"
```
#### Configuration Parameters:

- **Backend** :
   Backend parameter must be provided as “onnxmlir” while utilising ONNX-MLIR Backend. For more details related to backend [here](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/backend/blob/r24.07/README.md)
   
   ```
   backend: "onnxmlir"
   ```
   
- **Inputs and Outputs:** : 
    Each model input and output must specify a name, datatype, and shape. The name specified for an input or output tensor must match the name expected by the model. For more details on inputs and output tensors check documentation of Triton Inference server [here](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r24.07/docs/user_guide/model_configuration.md#inputs-and-outputs)
    
For more options see [Model Configuration](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r24.07/docs/user_guide/model_configuration.md).

NOTE: Multiple versions are supported, only positive values as version model are supported


## Snap ML C++ Backend <a id="snapml-cpp-backend"></a>

Snap Machine Learning (Snap ML in short) is a library for training and scoring traditional machine learning models with end to end inferencing capabilities. As part of the preprocessing pipeline it supports Normalizer, Kbinsdiscritizer, and one-hot encoding  transformers. 
This backend supports importing tree ensembles models that were trained with other frameworks (e.g., scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM) so one can leverage Integrated On-Chip Accelerator on IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE transparently via Snap ML’s accelerated inference engine. For more information on supported models refer Snap ML documentation [here](https://snapml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/model_import.html).

### Backend Usage Information
In Order to deploy any model on Triton Inference Server, one should have a model repository and Model configuration ready. 

Model Configuration: The model configuration  ```(config.pbtxt)``` in Triton Inference Server defines metadata, optimization settings, and customised  parameters for each model. This configuration ensures models are served with optimal performance and tailored behaviour.For more details [Model Configuration](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r24.07/docs/user_guide/model_configuration.md).

### Models Repository
Like all Triton backends, models deployed via the Snap ML C++ Backend make use of a specially laid-out "model repository" directory containing at least one serialized model and a "config.pbtxt" configuration file.

Typically, a models directory should look like below: 

```
models
└── test_snapml_model
    │   ├── 1
    │       ├── model.pmml
    │       └── pipeline.json
    └── config.pbtxt

```

Given above is sample for ```pmml``` format. User should change the model formats as per the model framework chosen.

pipeline.json: This is optional and required to be provided only when pre-processing is chosen. 

### Model Configuration
Every Snap ML C++ Backend model must provide config.pbtxt file describing the model configuration.
Below is a sample ```config.pbtxt``` for Snap ML C++ Backend:

```
max_batch_size: 32
input {
  name: "IN0"
  data_type: TYPE_FP32
  dims: 5
}
output {
  name: "OUT0"
  data_type: TYPE_FP64
  dims: 1
}
instance_group  {
   count: 2
   kind: KIND_CPU
}
dynamic_batching {
  preferred_batch_size: 32
  max_queue_delay_microseconds: 25000
}
parameters {
  key: "MODEL_FILE_FORMAT"
  value {
    string_value: "pmml"
  }
}
backend: "ibmsnapml"

```
### Configuration Parameters:

- **Backend** :
   Backend parameter must be provided as “ibmsnapml” while utilising Snap ML C++ Backend.
   ```
   backend: "ibmsnapml"
   ```
- **PREPROCESSING_FILE** :
   This configuration file parameter specifies the name of the file to be used for preprocessing. The preprocessing file must be named as ‘pipeline.json’
   when preprocessing is selected for end-to-end inferencing.

   If this parameter is not provided, the backend assumes that preprocessing is not required,even if pipeline.json is present in the model repository.

   ```
   parameters {
   key: "PREPROCESSING_FILE"
   value {
   string_value: "pipeline.json"
   }
   }
   ```
   ***Note*** : The ```‘pipeline.json’``` is serialised preprocessing pipeline captured during training using Snap ML API ```(export_preprocessing_pipeline(pipeline_xgb['preprocessor'],'pipeline.json’)```.For more details visit [here](https://snapml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pipeline_export.html).
   
- **SNAPML_TARGET_CLASS** :
   This configuration parameter specifies which model needs to be imported by Snap ML C++ Backend as per Snap ML documentation [here](https://snapml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/model_import.html).

   ```
   parameters {
   key: "SNAPML_TARGET_CLASS"
   value {
   string_value: "BoostingMachineClassifier"
   }
   }

   ```
   For example, pre-trained model is ```‘sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier’ ``` then target  SnapML  class should ```‘snapml.RandomForestClassifier’``` . In case of C++ backend same target class will be referred as ```‘RandomForestClassifier’```  as a value for ```SNAPML_TARGET_CLASS``` in the config.pbtxt.
   
- **MODEL_FILE_FORMAT** :   
   Model File Format provided in the configuration file should be as per the Snap ML supported  models. Refer to Snap ML documentation [here](https://snapml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/model_import.html)

   ```
   parameters {
     key: "MODEL_FILE_FORMAT"
     value {
       string_value: "pmml"
     }
   
   ```   
- **NUM_OF_PREDICT_THREADS** :  
    This defines the CPU threads running for each inference call.
  ```
    parameters {
    key: "NUM_OF_PREDICT_THREADS"
    value {
      string_value: "12"
    }
  }
  
  ``` 
- **PREDICT_PROBABILITY** : 
    This Configuration parameter  controls whether the model’s prediction is to be in terms of   probability. 

  If Predict probability is choosen user should add the ```PREDICT_PROBABILITY``` parameter and set the ```output``` dimensions to 2, as it will return probabilities for both classes in a      binary classification, as shown below:
  
  Note that  ```PREDICT_PROBABILITY``` is case sensitive and accepts only ```‘true’``` or ```‘false’``` . Any other values apart from these like 
  (True/False/1/0) are provided , by default ```‘false’``` will be assumed and it will not provide the probability.
    
    ```
     output {
      name: "OUT0"
      data_type: TYPE_FP64
      dims: 2
    }
    parameters {
     key: "PREDICT_PROBABILITY"
     value {
      string_value: "true"
     }
    }
    ```
    
- **Inputs and Outputs:** : 
    Each model input and output must specify a name, datatype, and shape( for more details on 
    inputs and output tensors check documentation of Triton Inference server [here](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r24.07/docs/user_guide/model_configuration.md#model-configuration)).The name specified for an input or output tensor must match the name 
    expected by the model. An input shape indicates the shape of an input tensor expected by the model and by Triton inference request. An output 
    shape indicates the shape of an output tensor produced by the model and returned by Triton in response to an inference request. Both input and output 
    shape must have rank greater-or-equal-to 1, that is, the empty shape [ ] is not allowed.In case of preprocessing, the data type of Input 
    must be ```TYPE_STRING```and output tensor is ```TYPE_FP32```. For more details on 
    supported tensor data types by Triton Inference server ,vist [here](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r24.07/docs/user_guide/model_configuration.md#datatypes).

# Triton Model Analyzer<a id="triton-model-analyzer"></a>
Triton Model Analyzer is a CLI tool which can help you find a more optimal configuration, on a given piece of hardware,
for single, multiple, ensemble, or BLS models running on a Triton Inference Server. It will also generate reports to
help you better understand the trade-offs of the different configurations along with their compute and memory requirements.

Triton Model Analyzer uses Triton Performance Analyzer to calculate inefernce server side metrics.

## Triton Performance Analyzer:
Triton Performance Analyzer is CLI tool which can help you optimize the inference performance of models running on Triton
Inference Server by measuring changes in performance as you experiment with different optimization strategies.

Automatically runs multiple configuration combinations provided search (Optuna, Quick, Brute, Manual) in different modes(Remote, Local)

Metrics : Provides multiple metrics Throughput (infer/sec), P99/ p95/ p90/ p50/ Average Latency (ms),  Inference count RAM Usage vs Latency, Server compute output, input, infer, queue time

Detailed and summary reports: Model Analyzer is  able to generate summarized and detailed reports that can help you better understand the trade-offs between different model configurations that can be used for your mode

QoS (Quality of Service) Constraints: Constraints can help you filter out the Model Analyzer results based on your QoS requirements.

NOTE: If your model requires a custom backend when running on the Triton Inference Server please use either local or remote mode. [here](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/model_analyzer/blob/r24.07/docs/launch_modes.md)

NOTE: We support only ```KIND_CPU```. Need to pass ```cpu_only: true``` parameter in config.yaml [here](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/model_analyzer/issues/927)

## Configuring Model Analyzer:
    Model Analyzer must provide the yaml file whcih contains the information about the model profiling:
    
    LOCAL MODE: Local mode is the default mode if no triton-launch-mode is specified.
    ```
    model_repository: /models
    profile_models: 
      model1:
        perf_analyzer_flags:
          input-data: input.json(path to the input file/directory)
        cpu_only: true
    run_config_search_mode: quick
    run_config_search_max_instance_count: 4
    run_config_search_max_concurrency: 16
    run_config_search_min_model_batch_size: 8
    override_output_model_repository: true

    ```
    REMOTE MODE:This mode is beneficial when you want to use an already running Triton Inference Server.
    You may provide the URLs for the Triton instance's HTTP or GRPC endpoint depending on your chosen client 
    protocol using the --triton-grpc-endpoint, and --triton-http-endpoint flags.Triton Server in this mode needs to be 
    launched with --model-control-mode explicit flag to support loading/unloading of the models.
    ```
    run_config_search_disable: True
    concurrency: [2, 4, 8, 16, 32]
    batch_sizes: [8, 16, 32]
    profile_models:
      model1:
        perf_analyzer_flags:
          input-data: input.json(path to the input file/directory)
        cpu_only: true
        model_config_parameters:
          dynamic_batching:
            max_queue_delay_microseconds: [200, 400]
          instance_group:
            - kind: KIND_CPU
              count: [1,2]
    client_protocol: http
    collect_cpu_metrics: True
    triton_launch_mode: remote
    triton_http_endpoint: <TRITON_SERVER_IP>:<EXPOSED_HTTP_PORT_NUM>
    triton_grpc_endpoint: <TRITON_SERVER_IP>:<EXPOSED_GRPC_PORT_NUM>
    triton_metrics_url:   <TRITON_SERVER_IP>:<EXPOSED_METRIC_PORT_NUM>/metrics
    override_output_model_repository: true
    ```

    To pass the data as real input file json -  the tensors need to be flattened in a row-major format `data.flatten('C')`

    Example of input.json file:
    ```
    {"data":
      [
        {
          "IN0":
            {   "content":[
                "92.5596638292661",
                "7.103605819788694",
                "abcd",
                "efgh"
            ],
                "shape": [4]
            }
    }]} 
    ```


    Example of directory:
    Directory must contains the file with the same name of Input mentioned in config.pbtxt of the model. Example here `IN0`
    Text inside `IN0` present in below format
    ```
    92.5596638292661
    7.103605819788694
    abcd
    efgh
    ```

## Model Management <a id="tis-model-mgmt-restapi"></a>

Triton Inference Server operates in one of three model control modes: NONE,
EXPLICIT, or POLL. The model control determines how Triton Inference Server
handles changes to the model repository and which protocols and APIs are
available.

More details about model management can be found
[here](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r24.07/docs/user_guide/model_management.md)

### Model Repository <a id="tis-model-repository-restapi"></a>

The model-repository extension allows a client to query and control the one or
more model repositories being served by Triton Inference Server.

- Index API
  - POST `v2/repository/index`
- Load API
  - POST `v2/repository/models/${MODEL_NAME}/load`
- unload API
  - POST `v2/repository/models/${MODEL_NAME}/unload`

For more details about the model repository index, load and unload API calls
please visit the Triton documentation website link
[here](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r24.07/docs/protocol/extension_model_repository.md)

### Model Configuration <a id="tis-model-config-restapi"></a>

The model configuration extension allows Triton Inference Server to return server-specific information.

GET `v2/models/${MODEL_NAME}[/versions/${MODEL_VERSION}]/config`

For more details about the model configuration API calls please visit the Triton
documentation website link
[here](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r24.07/docs/protocol/extension_model_configuration.md)

### Custom Model Configuration

The Triton Inference Server allows multiple configuration files for the same model within a model repository. This feature is useful when you want to maintain different configurations for the same model without duplicating the model files. You can specify which configuration to use by leveraging the --model-config-name option when launching the server.

Ex: ```--model-config-name=preprocessing```

This option tells Triton to use the configuration named preprocessing (without including the .pbtxt extension). By doing this, you can seamlessly switch between different configurations for the same model, such as configurations for preprocessing, batching, or inference settings, without modifying the model repository itself. For more details check [here](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r24.07/docs/user_guide/model_configuration.md?plain=1#L324)


### Model Metadata <a id="tis-model-metadata-restapi"></a>

Model Metadata per-model endpoint provides the following details

GET `v2/models/${MODEL_NAME}[/versions/${MODEL_VERSION}]`

- name : The name of the model.
- versions : The model versions that may be explicitly requested via the
  appropriate endpoint. Optional for servers that don’t support versions.
  Optional for models that don’t allow a version to be explicitly requested.
- platform : The framework/backend for the model. See
  [Platforms](https://github.com/kserve/kserve/blob/master/docs/predict-api/v2/required_api.md#platforms).
- inputs : The inputs required by the model.

## Version policy

Below details provides how the version policy been applied while model with different versions available in the model repository.

### Snap ML C++ and ONNX_MLIR backends with the -1 version

```text
|-- model_1
|   |-- -1
|   |   `-- model.txt
|   `-- config.pbtxt

+-----------+---------+--------+
| model_1   | 0       | READY  |
| model_2   | 0       | READY  |
+-----------+---------+--------+
```

### Python and onnx-mlir backend with the 1 version

```text
|-- model_1
|   |-- 1
|   |   |-- model.py
|   |   `-- model.txt
|   `-- config.pbtxt
`-- model_2

+-----------+---------+--------+
| model_1   | 1       | READY  |
| model_2   | 1       | READY  |
+-----------+---------+--------+
```

Each model can have one or more versions. The ModelVersionPolicy property of the
model configuration is used to set one of the following policies. 

• All: Load all the versions of the model.All versions of the model that are available in the model repository are available for inferencing. `version_policy: { all: {}} `

• Latest: Only the latest ‘n’versions of the model in the repository are available for inferencing. The latest versions of the model are the numerically greatest version numbers.`version_policy: { latest: { num_versions: 2}}`

• Specific: Only the specifically listed versions of the model are available for inferencing. `version_policy: {specific: { versions: [1,3]}}` If no version policy is specified, then Latest (with n=1) is used as the default, indicating that only the most recent version of the model is made available by Triton. In all cases, the addition or removal of version subdirectories from the model repository can change which model version is used on subsequent inference requests.

### Version Policy check: All

#### Test backends with multiple versions along with -1

# Limitations and Known Issues <a id="limitations-known-issues"></a>

1. Consumer of Triton Inference Server may or may not face an issue when
   utilizing Triton Inference Server with a Python backend and an HTTP endpoint
   on a Big Endian machine, experience errors related to the TYPE_STRING
   datatype. For more details, see
   [link](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/issues/5610)

2. Consumer of Triton Inference server may or may not face an issue when running
   Triton Inference Server on a Big Endian machine, specifically related to GRPC
   calls with BYTES input. It appears that the current configuration may not
   fully support GRPC calls with BYTES input. For more details, see
   [link](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/issues/5811)

3. In case, user of Triton Inference Server want restrict access the protocols
   on a given endpoint by leveraging the configuration option
   '--grpc-restricted-protocol'. This feature provides fine-grained control over
   access to various endpoints by specifying protocols and associated restricted
   keys and values. Consumer of Triton Inference server may or may not find
   similar capability for restricting endpoint access for the HTTP protocol as
   currently not available. For more details, see
   [link](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/issues/5837)

4. Consumer of Triton server may or may not face an issue while having model with
   version -1 or model.py isn't present for python backend. For more details, see
   [link](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/issues/7052)
       

# Versions and Release cadence <a id="versioning"></a>

IBM Z Accelerated for NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server will follow the semantic
versioning guidelines with a few deviations. Overall IBM Z Accelerated for
NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server follows a continuous release model with a
cadence of 1-2 minor releases per year. In general, bug fixes will be applied to
the next minor release and not back ported to prior major or minor releases.
Major version changes are not frequent and may include features supporting new
IBM Z hardware as well as major feature changes in Triton Inference Server that
are not likely backward compatible.

## IBM Z Accelerated for for NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server versions

Each release version of IBM Z Accelerated for NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server
has the form MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (X.Y.Z). For example, IBM Z Accelerated for
NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server version 1.2.3 has MAJOR version 1, MINOR
version 2, and PATCH version 3. Changes to each number have the following
meaning:

### MAJOR / VERSION

All releases with the same major version number will have API compatibility.
Major version numbers will remain stable. For instance, 1.Y.Z may last 1 year or
more. It will potentially have backwards incompatible changes. Code and data
that worked with a previous major release will not necessarily work with the new
release.

`Note:` pybind11 PyRuntimes, any other python packages for versions of Python
that have reached end of life can be removed or updated to newer stable version
without a major release increase change.

### MINOR / FEATURE

Minor releases will typically contain new backward compatible features,
improvements, and bug fixes.

### PATCH / MAINTENANCE

Maintenance releases will occur more frequently and depend on specific patches
introduced (e.g. bug fixes) and their urgency. In general, these releases are
designed to patch bugs.

## Release cadence

Feature releases for IBM Z Accelerated for NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server
occur about every 6 months in general. Hence, IBM Z Accelerated for NVIDIA
Triton™ Inference Server X.3.0 would generally be released about 6 months after
X.2.0. Maintenance releases happen as needed in between feature releases. Major
releases do not happen according to a fixed schedule.

| Input data errors    | When sending requests to the Triton server, issues might arise with the input data provided by the client. This could include incorrect data types, shape mismatches, or missing required inputs. Any valid request batched with invalid request might lead to either inaccurate or invalid response by inference server to the entire batch.                                                                                              |
| Inference errors     | Errors during the inference process can happen due to problems with the model's architecture or issues within the model's code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Resource errors      | Triton uses system resources like CPU and memory to perform inference. Errors can occur if there are resource allocation problems or resource constraints are not handled properly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Networking errors    | Triton is a server that communicates with clients over the network. Network-related issues such as timeouts, connection problems, or firewall restrictions can lead to errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Configuration errors | Misconfigurations in the Triton server settings or environment variables could result in unexpected behavior or failures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Scaling errors       | When deploying Triton in a distributed or multi-instance setup, errors can occur due to load balancing issues, communication problems between instances, or synchronization failures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
